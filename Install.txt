The following guide is an example installation with an Ubuntu server 14.04
running the Call Manager, with the Asterisk PBX running on a diffent server.

On the Ubuntu server that will run the Call Manager:

$ sudo apt-get install nodejs mongodb git npm
$ git clone https://github.com/soporte-greencore/Gcs-Call-Manager.git
$ cd Gcs-Call-Manager/
$ npm install
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli

Change the IP of the PBX, as well as the user and password of you choosing.
$ vim config/config.js

                ami: {
                        host: '10.42.20.20',
                        port: 'default',
                        username: 'dev',
                        password: 'phos7oH6'
                }


On the PBX server with asterisk:

Add a Manager user to the Asterisk AMI. Remember to use the same user/password
as in the config/config.js configuration file.
$ sudo vim /etc/asterisk/manager.conf
[dev]
secret=phos7oH6
deny=0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
permit=manager-ip/255.255.255.255
read=system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user
write=system,call,log,verbose,command,agent,user

$ sudo asterisk -rc
asterisk> reload

Now you can visit the Call Manager to review the results:

http://manager-ip:3001/login
username: admin
password: greencoreAdmin

As a final step, secure the system by reviewing the created users and 
changing their passwords.
